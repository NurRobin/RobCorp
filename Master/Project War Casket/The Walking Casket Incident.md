In the year **1895**, the first strange report of a **"walking" casket** was documented in a remote town within the German Empire. While one such report might be easy to dismiss, over the following two years, similar accounts began to surface from various parts of German territory. Witnesses described eerie moments when these caskets seemed to move on their own, sometimes vanishing just as mysteriously as they had appeared. The situation grew so alarming that the administration launched a large-scale investigation into the phenomenon.

Despite the extensive resources devoted to the investigation, officials found no concrete evidence or explanations. It was as if these caskets had materialized out of thin air—only to vanish without a trace. While the official narrative dismissed the reports as hysteria or fabrication, modern historians have begun to reconsider this mysterious chapter in light of new discoveries regarding RobCorp’s darker history. Many now believe that these early reports could have been linked to secretive experiments tied to **Project War-Casket**—a precursor to the company’s future, ethically dubious ventures.

### **Project War-Casket: Testing the Boundaries of Life and Death**
Some contemporary scholars theorize that the **Walking Casket Incident** and the infamous **[[Bloody Coffin Incident]]** were not isolated events. Instead, they believe these occurrences were tied to early experiments conducted by [[RobCorp]] (then known as [[Cornelius' Coffins]]) as part of the secretive **[[Project War-Casket]]**.

### **Ethical Dilemmas and Corporate Conspiracies**
The implications of these early experiments suggest a company willing to go to any lengths to **control the afterlife**—both in terms of logistics and metaphysical outcomes. The concept of **"walking" caskets** may represent early attempts at **autonomous, AI-driven containment systems**, designed to house or even potentially restore the dead. Alternatively, these caskets could have been part of experiments on **extending consciousness** beyond the physical body, with the caskets acting as vessels for individuals' prolonged mental states.

RobCorp’s involvement in these secret projects remains speculative, but the company’s continued advancements in **life preservation** and **War-Casket technology** in later centuries give credence to the idea that their experiments with death and resurrection have been ongoing for much longer than publicly acknowledged.

By the time RobCorp entered the interstellar age, these early breakthroughs may have laid the foundation for their **Stasis Coffins**, **War-Caskets**, and even **Time Capsule Memorials**—all modern services built on the same core ideas of **controlling life and death** for profit.

### **New Moral Questions for RobCorp’s Future**
With the resurgence of the **Walking Casket Incident** and further revelations surrounding **Project War-Casket**, the darker side of RobCorp’s history presents several ethical dilemmas:
1. **Is it morally acceptable to blur the lines between life and death in pursuit of profit?**
2. **What are the consequences of experimenting with resurrection technologies or sentient caskets?**
3. **How much control should one corporation have over the afterlife, and at what cost to humanity's moral integrity?**

These dilemmas would shape RobCorp's modern-day narrative, painting them as both a **visionary megacorporation** and a **potentially dangerous entity**, constantly pushing the boundaries of what it means to preserve life and legacy across the stars.
