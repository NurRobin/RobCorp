## **Expanded Timeline and Ideas**

### **1900 to 22nd Century: Early Expansion, Government Ties, and Interstellar Ventures**

#### **1900-1930s: Underground Expansion**

- After expanding across the German Empire, **[[Cornelius' Coffins]]** diversified, investing in discreet underground facilities dedicated to R&D, enabling hidden projects like **[[Project War-Casket]]**.

- These hidden facilities were scattered across Europe and allowed early testing of prototypes and experiments away from public scrutiny.


#### **1933-1945: "[[The Big Vacation]]"**

- Officially, Cornelius' Coffins claimed all employees were "on vacation," while they consolidated resources and laid low during turbulent times. This was a strategic low-profile period to avoid scrutiny from wartime authorities.

- During this time, many propaganda officers emerged and later became **[[Propaganda Expert|Propaganda Experts]]** within Cornelius' Coffins, reshaping the company’s image after 1945.


#### **1946: Rebranding to [[RobCorp]]**

- With the war over, **Cornelius' Coffins** rebranded to **RobCorp** to shift focus towards government contracts. This marked a significant transformation into a company with a dual focus: providing stasis technology for suspended animation and expanding into government services.

### **Late 25th to 26th Century: The Messer Era**

#### **2545-2792: The Messer Era**

- During this time, RobCorp was closely linked with the **United Empire of Earth (UEE)**. They provided containment and stasis technologies for high-ranking officials and influential figures, playing a crucial role in maintaining order across the expanding UEE.

- **Operation Nemesis (2544)**: RobCorp provided covert support during key military operations, with stasis units ensuring the preservation of key military personnel. This connection to the military further entrenched RobCorp as a critical player in galactic politics.


#### **2789: Peace with Xi'an Empire**

- RobCorp capitalized on the newfound peace with the **Xi'an** by introducing **Time Capsule Memorials** to celebrate diplomatic achievements. Their propaganda experts used this opportunity to shift the company's public image from a war-time necessity to a symbol of unity and peace.

## **Founding Myths and Rumors**

### **[[Karl]]'s Mysterious Partnership**

- **The Bet of the Century**: The legend states that Karl joined [[Robert Cornelius|Cornelius]] due to losing a bet—but the nature of this bet has been left deliberately vague. Some rumors claim that Robert challenged Karl to build a coffin capable of imprisoning a restless spirit, while others say Karl bet against the success of Cornelius’ prototype of the **walking casket**.

- **Dark Pacts**: There are whispers that Karl and Cornelius struck a dark deal with an underground society devoted to occult knowledge. It’s said Karl was coerced into joining Cornelius because Robert held secrets—potentially regarding Karl’s involvement with forbidden rituals. This mysterious start contributes to RobCorp's aura of secrecy and mystique.


### **The Great Salesman**

- **Robert Cornelius** was known as a master salesman—there are records of his sales, but never any detail on what exactly he sold. While official records emphasize coffins and memorial services, whispers suggest he was selling far more than physical goods—perhaps information, influence, or even otherworldly pacts. This undefined background plays a major role in RobCorp’s secretive identity.

**Technology Evolution**

### **War-Casket Technology to Stasis Coffins**

- **Government Integration**: RobCorp realized the potential of its **[[Project War-Casket|War-Casket]]** technology for governmental uses, particularly in the military sector. By marketing early **AI-driven caskets** as “secure containment units,” RobCorp gained a foothold in secret government projects, including the development of stasis technologies for long-term storage of soldiers and other personnel.

- **AI Advancements**: The eerie autonomy exhibited during the **Walking Casket Incident** was an early iteration of AI integration. Over the years, RobCorp partnered with early AI pioneers to refine the technology, eventually developing **Stasis Coffins** capable of monitoring and maintaining physical functions during suspended animation, and later, **Time Capsule Memorials**, which used AI to recreate memories for grieving families.

- **Monetization and Expansion**: RobCorp's shift into government contracts offered a reliable income stream. With steady cash flow, they could expand their technology from secret projects into publicly marketable products—cementing their presence in both life and death management.

**Ethical Evolution and Propaganda**

### **Corporate Duality**

- **Pushing Boundaries vs. Creating Iconic Products**: RobCorp’s history reflects an ongoing balance between pushing boundaries and offering revolutionary products. They took unethical experiments—such as the resurrection technologies tested through the **War-Casket**—and turned them into public-facing innovations like **Stasis Coffins**. Essentially, what began as ethically dubious projects evolved into services celebrated by elites for their ingenuity.


### **Role of Propaganda Experts**

- **Recruitment Post-Vacation**: During **“The Big Vacation”**, many propaganda officers who found themselves without jobs became part of RobCorp’s new PR department. These **Propaganda Experts** were instrumental in reshaping RobCorp’s public image—highlighting its memorial services and downplaying the company’s macabre experiments.

- **Narrative Control**: They were highly skilled in crafting messages that glorified RobCorp's work while carefully hiding any sinister history. The **[[Bloody Coffin Incident]]**, for instance, was reframed as a tragic accident that inadvertently solidified Cornelius' Coffins as the best in the business. Their work ensured that the public saw only the grandeur and innovation, never the risks and sacrifices behind them.
