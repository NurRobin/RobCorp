- **Prototype Testing**: During the late 1990s, early prototypes of **Stasis Coffins** were tested, focusing on keeping astronauts in stasis during extended missions. These prototypes laid the groundwork for interstellar stasis solutions that would later become a cornerstone of RobCorp's offerings.
    

### **Toward Interstellar Expansion (2000s-2100)**

- **AI Integration**: In the early 21st century, advancements in computing allowed **RobCorp** to integrate AI more effectively into their products. By the 2050s, **AI-driven caskets** capable of maintaining physical functions and monitoring the health of individuals in stasis became commercially viable, setting the stage for their use in both governmental and civilian applications.
    
- **Government and Commercial Contracts**: Throughout the 21st century, **RobCorp** secured lucrative contracts with space agencies and private companies, further expanding their influence and solidifying their role in the burgeoning interstellar economy.
    

### **Early Space Ventures (22nd Century)**

- As the first Martian colonies emerged, **RobCorp** began offering **Time Capsule Memorials** to preserve legacies beyond Earth. The **[[Mars Tragedy of 2125]]** led to the company becoming involved in interplanetary body recovery and legacy preservation, cementing its transition from Earth-based operations to interstellar activities.

**Founding Myths and Rumors**

### **[[Karl]]'s Mysterious Partnership**

- **The Bet of the Century**: The legend states that Karl joined [[Robert Cornelius|Cornelius]] due to losing a bet—but the nature of this bet has been left deliberately vague. Some rumors claim that Robert challenged Karl to build a coffin capable of imprisoning a restless spirit, while others say Karl bet against the success of Cornelius’ prototype of the **walking casket**.
    
- **Dark Pacts**: There are whispers that Karl and Cornelius struck a dark deal with an underground society devoted to occult knowledge. It’s said Karl was coerced into joining Cornelius because Robert held secrets—potentially regarding Karl’s involvement with forbidden rituals. This mysterious start contributes to RobCorp's aura of secrecy and mystique.
    

### **The Great Salesman**

- **Robert Cornelius** was known as a master salesman—there are records of his sales, but never any detail on what exactly he sold. While official records emphasize coffins and memorial services, whispers suggest he was selling far more than physical goods—perhaps information, influence, or even otherworldly pacts. This undefined background plays a major role in RobCorp’s secretive identity.
