On the 2nd of January 1888 in front of [[Cornelius' Coffins]] two merchant families where arguing which one of them would get a coffin for from the esteemed coffin makers first. During their argument they managed to topple one of the standing coffins in the workshop. This lead to a horrifying chain reaction in which five people died. Ironically they where all put to rest in coffins from Cornelius' Coffins. Their families even got a fresh 2 for 1 deal paying only half the usual price.
