Project War-Casket, an initiative shrouded in mystery, is believed to have focused on pioneering **unofficial resurrection technologies**. These ranged from experimenting with **genetic revival techniques** to developing **sentient AI-driven caskets** capable of reanimation or providing extended life-support. If true, these experiments raise profound ethical questions about [[RobCorp]]â€™s motivations and their pursuit of technologies that blur the line between life and death.
