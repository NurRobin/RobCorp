### **The Man Behind the Myth**

Robert Cornelius, the enigmatic founder of what would eventually become **RobCorp**, was far more than a simple coffin maker. Born in the mid-19th century, Cornelius grew up in a small German town, honing his craft as a carpenter. His early life was shaped by his talent with woodwork, which began with furniture but quickly pivoted after a tragic event shook his hometown: the **whirlwind of 1886**. In its aftermath, Robert witnessed countless victims being thrown into mass graves, a sight that struck him deeply. It was this experience that transformed him, redirecting his skills from furniture production to the creation of **coffins** — a pursuit that soon grew into something much larger.

#### **The Whirlwind and the Founding of [[Cornelius' Coffins]]**

The tragic whirlwind event in **Crossen**, which left hundreds dead, spurred Cornelius to provide a more dignified end for the deceased. He crafted rudimentary coffins for those lost in the disaster, but over the next few years, Cornelius' craftsmanship improved, and his reputation began to spread. The quality of his coffins attracted the attention of not only the common people but also the wealthy and even minor nobility. By the late **1880s**, Cornelius' coffins were considered prestigious items, and demand was growing rapidly. It was during this time that **[[Karl]]**, a stonemason shrouded in mystery, joined him. While the exact reasons for Karl's partnership remain unclear, rumors persist about a wager or possibly even an occult pact that brought them together.

#### **An Entrepreneur and a Master Salesman**

Cornelius was known not only for his ability to craft high-quality coffins but also for his unmatched skills as a **salesman**. He managed to cultivate an image of exclusivity around his coffins, which made them a desirable commodity for both the living who purchased them for their eventual demise and the nobility who sought an honorable resting place. Cornelius became well-connected within the higher echelons of society, and while much of his business was conducted openly, some whispers suggested that his sales extended beyond mere coffins—into realms like **influence peddling**, **information brokering**, or even **otherworldly arrangements**. To this day, there are only vague records of what exactly Cornelius sold, adding to the air of mystery that surrounds him.

#### **Partnership with Karl: A Pact Beyond Business?**

Cornelius' partnership with **Karl** was another mystery that has persisted through history. Karl, a seasoned stonemason, supposedly lost a bet to Cornelius and subsequently joined the coffin-making endeavor. However, many believe the partnership was deeper than that, involving some form of **dark pact**. There are even whispers that Karl was coerced due to Robert's knowledge of Karl's dealings in forbidden rituals. Together, they expanded the company, now called **Cornelius' Coffins**, establishing a series of workshops across Europe. Some of these workshops were hidden deep underground, functioning as more than just coffin production sites—they were also early **R&D facilities** for secretive projects like **[[Project War-Casket]]**.

#### **[[Cascading Coffin Fatalities]] and the [[Bloody Coffin Incident]]**

The reputation of **Cornelius' Coffins** took an ominous turn following two strange incidents: the **Cascading Coffin Fatalities** of **1888** and the **Bloody Coffin Incident**. The former involved a bizarre chain reaction in the workshop, leading to multiple fatalities, ironically resulting in the use of Cornelius' own coffins for the victims. The latter incident, involving the mysterious deaths of **[[Gus Graveyard Services]]**' employees, happened just as Cornelius' Coffins was competing to secure the honor of [[A coffin for a King|crafting a coffin for Kaiser Wilhelm]]. Though there was no concrete evidence to implicate Cornelius in the event, it cemented the company's reputation as both **elite** and **eerie**, enhancing the enigmatic aura that surrounded Robert Cornelius himself.

#### **[[The Walking Casket Incident]] and Project War-Casket**

As Cornelius' reputation grew, so did the ambition of his projects. The strange reports of **"walking" caskets** that began surfacing in the **1890s** are believed by modern historians to be the early iterations of **Project War-Casket**. These incidents, where caskets appeared to move on their own, were dismissed by authorities at the time as mere hysteria. However, scholars now consider them a precursor to RobCorp's later advances in **AI-driven caskets** and **War-Casket technology**. Cornelius' early experiments seemed to blur the lines between life and death, and his willingness to explore such dangerous and ethically dubious territory laid the foundation for what [[RobCorp]] would become in the centuries that followed.

#### **Cornelius' Legacy: The Origins of RobCorp**

While **Robert Cornelius** himself did not live to see his company transition into **RobCorp**, his influence was indelible. By the time of his death, Cornelius' Coffins had grown into a powerful entity with significant influence, far beyond what a simple coffin maker might expect. The company's ability to pivot from funeral services to covert government contracts and interstellar operations all stemmed from Cornelius' initial ambition, cunning, and willingness to push ethical boundaries. The mystery surrounding his life, his business dealings, and the partnerships he forged are all key elements of RobCorp's **mythos** today—a corporation that has always existed at the cutting edge of both **technology** and **moral ambiguity**.

Cornelius left behind not just a company, but a **legacy of secrecy, innovation, and power**. The myths and rumors surrounding his life are now embedded in RobCorp's culture—a company that remains, even centuries later, both a beacon of technological advancement and a symbol of moral complexity.
