### **Karl: The Stonemason of Mystery**

**Karl**, the enigmatic figure who played a pivotal role in the early history of **[[Cornelius' Coffins]]**, remains a figure shrouded in rumors and secrecy. Unlike Robert Cornelius, Karl's background is far less documented, and much of what is known about him has been pieced together from fragmented records and whispered legends. As a **seasoned stonemason**, Karl was known for his craftsmanship and the precision of his work, which attracted the attention of [[Robert Cornelius]] in the late **1880s**. However, the exact nature of how Karl came to join Cornelius has been a subject of speculation ever since.

#### **The Bet of the Century**

One of the most enduring legends about Karl's partnership with **Robert Cornelius** revolves around a mysterious bet. It is said that Karl lost a wager to Cornelius, but the specifics of the bet are deliberately vague. Some sources suggest that Robert challenged Karl to create a coffin capable of imprisoning a restless spirit, while others say that Karl bet against the success of Cornelius' **prototype walking casket**, only to be proven wrong in spectacular fashion. This bet, regardless of its details, bound Karl to Cornelius, and it was this seemingly innocuous wager that would lead to Karl's deeper involvement in the company.

#### **A Pact Beyond Business**

While the bet may have been the catalyst, many believe there was more to Karl's partnership with Cornelius than just a lost wager. Rumors abound that Karl and Robert struck a **dark pact**—one involving an underground society devoted to **occult knowledge**. These whispers suggest that Robert may have coerced Karl into joining by holding secret knowledge over him—perhaps knowledge about Karl's own involvement in forbidden rituals or dealings with the supernatural. Whether or not these rumors hold any truth, they contributed to the mystique that surrounded Karl and his role in **Cornelius' Coffins**.

#### **Master of Stone and Secrets**

Karl's skills went beyond his work as a stonemason. As **Cornelius' Coffins** expanded, Karl became instrumental in the creation of hidden underground workshops across Europe. These workshops were not just for crafting coffins—they also served as early **research and development** facilities for the company's more secretive endeavors, such as **[[Project War-Casket]]**. Karl's expertise in stonework was crucial in concealing these facilities, ensuring that the company's experiments remained hidden from prying eyes. His contributions allowed Cornelius' Coffins to operate in secrecy, laying the foundation for the company's future as **RobCorp**.

#### **[[The Walking Casket Incident|The Walking Casket]] and War-Casket Projects**

Karl's involvement in the company's darker projects is evident in his connection to the infamous **Walking Casket Incident**. The moving caskets that were reported in the **1890s** were believed to be early experiments tied to **Project War-Casket**—a project aimed at pushing the boundaries between life and death. Karl's role in these experiments is unclear, but his expertise in crafting the physical vessels that housed these early prototypes suggests a deep involvement. The **walking caskets** were precursors to RobCorp's later advancements in **AI-driven caskets** and **War-Casket technology**, and Karl's work was integral to these early iterations.

#### **[[Bloody Coffin Incident|The Bloody Coffin Incident]]**

Another key moment in Karl's history was the **Bloody Coffin Incident**, which occurred just as **Cornelius' Coffins** was competing to secure the prestigious contract of [[A coffin for a King|crafting a coffin for Kaiser Wilhelm]]. During this time, Karl's reputation took a darker turn, as many suspected his involvement in the mysterious deaths of the employees of **[[Gus Graveyard Services]]**—Cornelius' main competitor. Though no evidence ever directly implicated Karl, the incident solidified his image as a man willing to go to any lengths to ensure the success of Cornelius' Coffins.

#### **A Legacy of Shadows**

Karl's influence on **Cornelius' Coffins**, and later **RobCorp**, cannot be understated. He was not just a partner but a crucial architect of the company's more secretive and ethically ambiguous operations. His stonework concealed their most clandestine projects, and his rumored dealings with the occult added an air of danger and mystery to the company's origins. While Karl may not have shared the limelight with Robert Cornelius, his role was vital in shaping the company's path toward technological innovation and moral complexity.

Today, Karl's contributions are largely overshadowed by those of Cornelius, but his legacy lives on in the secretive nature of RobCorp. The underground workshops, the hidden research, and the dark pacts all speak to a man who operated from the shadows, ensuring that the company could push boundaries without ever being truly seen. Karl was, and remains, an essential yet enigmatic figure in the foundation of a company that would go on to redefine the limits of **life, death, and legacy**.
