### **Mission**:
Officers, known as "Die Exekutive," are the hands that execute the CEO's will throughout [[RobCorp]]'s operations. They manage both the transport fleets and funeral operations, ensuring that clients' goods, as well as their memorials, arrive precisely where they need to be—on time, secure, and unblemished. The role of an Officer is not to lead, but to enforce and operationalize the unyielding directives of the CEO. Their loyalty is to be unshakable, and their dedication unquestioned.

### **Core Responsibilities**:

1. **Fleet Management**: Command the transport fleets to move high-value assets, adhering strictly to the schedules dictated by the CEO.

Officers must ensure that every asset—whether a shipment of critical goods or a memorial item—is shielded from any threat. The use of lethal force, if necessary, is not just authorized; it is expected to uphold the sanctity of RobCorp’s operations.
    
4. **Coordination Across Units**: Collaborate with other Officers and departments to maintain synchronization between cargo transport and funeral services. There is no room for error in the logistics of RobCorp; the movement of goods and memories must proceed seamlessly.
    
5. **Client Liaison**: Engage directly with clients to confirm and finalize the details of transportation and memorial services. Officers serve as the face of RobCorp’s operational might, reassuring clients that both their assets and their legacies are handled with the precision and security that RobCorp guarantees.
