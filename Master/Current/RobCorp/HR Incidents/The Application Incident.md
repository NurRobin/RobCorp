#### **Overview and Context**

The **Application Incident** is widely regarded as one of the most perplexing events in RobCorp’s history. It revolves around the hiring of an employee known only as *FlyClumsy*, whose application was submitted entirely in Chinese—a language that had been considered extinct for decades following the global collapse of linguistic preservation initiatives.  

The translation of the application was reluctantly performed by Die Rote Sonne, the Grand Archivist of RobCorp, who viewed the task as beneath his station and a waste of valuable archival resources. Despite his objections and the mundane nature of the translated contents, FlyClumsy was immediately hired into a newly created role titled “Court Jester”—a position that had no precedent, definition, or practical function within the company.

This incident has since sparked endless debate among employees, with many questioning the rationale behind FlyClumsy’s employment and the true purpose of his mysterious role.

#### **Sequence of Events**

1. **9:00 AM – Submission of Application:**  
   The RobCorp Human Resources department receives an unsolicited employment application written entirely in archaic Chinese. The document is unsigned, though it includes identifying information pointing to an individual known only as *FlyClumsy*. The HR team, baffled by the language and format of the application, escalates the issue to upper management.

2. **10:30 AM – Summoning of the Grand Archivist:**  
   After multiple failed attempts to interpret the document internally, CEO NurRobin orders the Grand Archivist, Die Rote Sonne, to translate it. The Archivist is visibly displeased with this request, viewing it as a misuse of his time and expertise, but complies out of obligation.

3. **12:00 PM – Translation Completed:**  
   Die Rote Sonne completes the translation with minimal effort, revealing contents that are described as “mundane” and “unremarkable.” The application contains no special qualifications or skills outside of vague references to “entertainment” and “morale-boosting” activities—none of which would seem applicable to any known position at RobCorp.

4. **12:15 PM – Immediate Hiring Decision:**  
   Despite the lackluster contents and the Grand Archivist’s explicit disdain for the applicant, FlyClumsy is hired on the spot by direct order of CEO NurRobin. No interview is conducted. Instead, FlyClumsy is assigned a newly created title: *Court Jester*. Confusion spreads throughout HR regarding the necessity and purpose of this new role.

5. **1:00 PM – Employee Status Formalized:**  
   FlyClumsy’s employment status is formally recorded in RobCorp’s internal systems. His department is listed as “Undefined,” and his official working hours remain at zero. He does not physically appear at RobCorp HQ on his first day—or any day thereafter. 

6. **Ongoing Absenteeism:**  
   Since his hiring, FlyClumsy has maintained a perfect record of absenteeism, never once showing up for work or reporting any activities. Despite this, he remains employed and continues to receive promotions under unclear circumstances—further deepening the mystery surrounding him.

#### **Internal Reactions**

- **HR Department Analysis:**  
  *“We have no idea why this happened. There’s no logical reason anyone with that application should have been hired—let alone given such an odd title. We’ve received no further instructions on what this ‘Court Jester’ role entails or how it fits within RobCorp’s structure. As far as we can tell, FlyClumsy doesn’t even exist in any functional way.”*  

- **Supervisor's Note:**  
  *“This defies all corporate protocols. Even by RobCorp standards, hiring someone based on an indecipherable application without any actual qualifications is unprecedented. Yet here we are.”*

---

#### **CEO NurRobin’s Remark:**  
*"Sometimes you need someone who doesn’t follow the rules to remind you why you wrote them in the first place... or why you should ignore them entirely. FlyClumsy might be absent, but in his absence, he’s doing exactly what I want—stirring things up without lifting a finger."*  
*(NurRobin’s cryptic remark suggests that FlyClumsy serves some larger purpose in his strategy—one rooted less in productivity and more in disruption.)*

---

#### **Grand Archivist’s Remark:**  
*"Chinese? A dead language resurrected just to waste my time? If I had known this would lead to such folly, I would have left it untranslated. And this ‘Court Jester’ nonsense offends my sensibilities—there is no record of jesters being relevant to our mission! Why he parades around in such attire is a question for historians far less discerning than myself."*  
*(Die Rote Sonne clearly harbors resentment toward both the task of translating FlyClumsy’s application and FlyClumsy himself.)*

#### **Post-Incident Outcomes**

Since his hiring, FlyClumsy has remained a ghost within RobCorp—a figure whose name appears in internal directories but whose presence feels more like a myth than reality. His complete absence from work has not hindered his career progression; if anything, it seems to have fueled his rise through the ranks. Over time, FlyClumsy has garnered a cult-like reputation among certain circles within RobCorp as an enigmatic force of disruption.

Efforts to investigate the origins of FlyClumsy’s employment have been met with sealed records and redacted files—suggesting that there may be deeper forces at play behind his continued existence within RobCorp’s ranks.

### **Final Commentary Section: CEO & Grand Archivist Dialogue**

**CEO NurRobin:**  
*"You know, even if FlyClumsy never shows up for a single day of work—which he hasn’t—I’m glad we brought him on board. He’s shaking things up just by existing... or not existing. Either way works for me. Sometimes disruption is more important than productivity."*

**Grand Archivist (Die Rote Sonne):**  
*"Disruption? Disruption! You’ve allowed a man draped in ridiculous historic garb to infiltrate our ranks under the guise of ‘employment,’ and you call it disruption? It’s an insult to the Archives—to history itself! His very presence tarnishes everything we stand for."*

**CEO NurRobin:**  
*"I think you’re taking this a bit too seriously. The Archives will survive one harmless jester—besides, he adds a bit of color to this otherwise sterile corporate environment."*

**Grand Archivist (Die Rote Sonne):**  
*"Color? What you call ‘color,’ I call corruption—a stain upon our legacy."*

**CEO NurRobin:**  
*"Stains can be washed out. Or maybe they become part of something new. Either way, change is inevitable."*

#### **Conclusion**

The Application Incident remains one of RobCorp’s most enigmatic moments—an event that defies conventional corporate logic and highlights both CEO NurRobin’s comfort with chaos and Die Rote Sonne’s passion for order and historical integrity.

FlyClumsy has not shown up for work since being hired—and yet his presence lingers, challenging RobCorp’s rigid systems and protocols merely by existing (or not existing). For now, he remains an unsolved mystery within RobCorp’s complex tapestry—both a symbol of disruption and a source of frustration for those who value tradition.

Despite all obstacles, FlyClumsy continues to thrive within RobCorp’s unorthodox hierarchy—a testament to the power of unpredictability in shaping corporate destiny.
