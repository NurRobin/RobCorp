### **Overview**

H1ryu is an anomaly within RobCorp’s workforce. Despite numerous attempts to fire him—or otherwise remove him from the company—he continues to persist, and even more bafflingly, has been promoted multiple times. Once a lowly Cargo Boy, H1ryu now holds the dual roles of Middle Manager in Human Waste Management and an officer within "Die Exekutive." How he achieved these roles remains as mysterious as his continued employment.

Numerous details regarding his career trajectory have been redacted, with much of his history locked away in the archives, overseen by Die Rote Sonne, the [[Grand Archivist]]. Attempts to access these records have been consistently denied, leaving a significant portion of H1ryu's story shrouded in secrecy.

### **Problematic Behavior**

If one were tasked with designing the perfect example of an employee you *don't* want, H1ryu would be the prototype. His daily routine is an exercise in corporate defiance:

- **Chronically late**: H1ryu’s arrival time fluctuates wildly, often well after official working hours have started.
- **Extended breaks**: He consistently takes breaks that far exceed any reasonable limit. These "breaks" are often marked by loud conversations about his personal life or indulgent meals.
- **Early departures**: Without fail, H1ryu manages to leave work before the designated end of his shift—often citing vague health concerns or "important personal matters."
- **Misuse of company resources**: When he does occupy his desk, he’s either chatting with coworkers about irrelevant topics or playing games on his company-issued computer. Despite several warnings, he continues to treat the office like his personal lounge.

> **CEO Remark:**  
> *"I stopped counting how many termination papers I signed for this guy. Yet, here he is—still breathing RobCorp air. At this point, maybe we should start charging him rent."* — NurRobin

### **Negative Influence on Workplace Culture**

H1ryu’s influence extends beyond his own poor work habits. He tends to encourage other employees to join him in less-than-professional activities:

- **Motivating drinking culture**: H1ryu has become infamous for rallying coworkers to drink during work hours—or immediately after. His energy for organizing impromptu social events has caused more than a few HR headaches.
- **[[Beer Pong Incident]]**: Perhaps most famously, H1ryu once hosted a beer pong tournament in the company cafeteria during working hours. Several employees became *overly* enthusiastic participants, resulting in a temporary shutdown of operations in two departments.
  
> **Supervisor’s Note:**  
> *"The beer pong situation was... unforgivable. But somehow, he didn’t just survive it—he got promoted after.*"

### **Personality Profile**

H1ryu’s personality is as troublesome as his work ethic. Small inconveniences can send him into fits of rage, and he is known for getting *salty* over even minor disruptions. He also has an insatiable appetite that contradicts his thin frame—an oddity noted by nearly everyone who has had the misfortune of dining near him.

- **Easily frustrated**: Whether it’s a slow internet connection or a misplaced stapler, anything that slightly deviates from his expectations causes an immediate and vocal outburst.
- **Voracious Eater**: Despite being unusually thin, H1ryu consumes food at a rate that would rival a walrus preparing for hibernation. It’s not uncommon for him to finish multiple meals during a single lunch break—and then complain about hunger an hour later.

> **Coworker Testimonial:**  
> *"I’ve seen him put away four sandwiches, two salads, and three bags of chips... and then ask if anyone had extra snacks."*

### **[[The Archives Incident]]**

In what appeared to be a desperate final attempt to rid RobCorp of H1ryu’s presence, CEO NurRobin once arranged for H1ryu to be sent on an unannounced trip to the **Archives**—a journey from which no one was expected to return. Yet, against all odds (and corporate expectations), H1ryu returned. Not only did he survive—a feat unheard of—but in some strange twist of fate, he managed to earn the favor of Die Rote Sonne, the enigmatic Grand Archivist.

It remains unclear whether this unlikely relationship formed before or after H1ryu’s visit to the Archives. What is certain is that since returning from his trip, Die Rote Sonne has shown a peculiar affinity for H1ryu, occasionally granting him access to parts of the Archives normally reserved for high-ranking officials and scholars.

> **Grand Archivist Remark:**  
> *"Perhaps chaos has its place in preservation. Or perhaps he simply amuses me. The Archives shift for those who deserve their secrets."* — Die Rote Sonne

Given the Grand Archivist’s usual disdain for corporate employees—and his general distrust of anyone outside the Archives—this connection between the two remains one of RobCorp's greatest mysteries.

### **Promotion Path (Despite All Reason)**

H1ryu’s inexplicable rise through the ranks is one of the most baffling aspects of his tenure at RobCorp. Starting as a simple Cargo Boy (a position some argue he still should hold—or rather be fired from), H1ryu has somehow climbed to middle management within Human Waste Management and earned the rank of "Die Exekutive," a role requiring precision, discipline, and unwavering obedience—qualities that H1ryu demonstrably lacks.

> **CEO Remark:**  
> *"At this point, it's easier to promote him than deal with him. And maybe if we keep promoting him fast enough, he'll eventually disappear into some obscure department where no one has to deal with his nonsense."* — NurRobin

Despite numerous complaints from colleagues and endless performance issues documented (and subsequently redacted), promotions have continued without explanation. Some speculate that there may be a deeper reason behind his ability to remain within RobCorp's ranks—though any attempt to investigate further has met with sealed files and heavy archival protections.

---

### **Conclusion**

H1ryu is a walking contradiction—a subpar employee who has inexplicably risen through RobCorp’s ranks despite consistently breaking every rule in the book. His ability to survive multiple termination attempts remains unmatched, and his strange connection with Die Rote Sonne adds an even greater layer of mystery to his existence.

While many within RobCorp view him as nothing more than a nuisance (albeit one they can't seem to get rid of), others have begun to wonder if there might be something more at play—some unseen force propelling H1ryu ever onward through the corporate ladder.

For now, it seems that H1ryu is here to stay. Whether that’s a victory for chaos or evidence of some deeper cosmic joke remains to be seen.

## **Final Commentary**

**NurRobin (CEO):**  
*"He’s a cockroach that refuses to die. Maybe we should just give him his own department and let him run it into the ground. Then again, knowing my luck, he'd probably turn it into our most profitable division."*

**Die Rote Sonne (Grand Archivist):**  
*"There is art in entropy. Perhaps H1ryu is not meant to be understood or controlled, but simply observed as he disrupts and reshapes the corporate world around him. Or perhaps I'm just entertained by watching everyone else try to contain him."*
