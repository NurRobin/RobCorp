### **Overview:**
FlyClumsy is an anomalous employee within [[RobCorp]], one whose presence in the ranks has caused confusion across multiple departments—especially the Archives. Despite never having shown up to work since his employment, he was inexplicably elevated to the rank of "Court Jester" upon hire. This role, which has no formal definition or practical application within RobCorp's highly structured hierarchy, seems to exist solely for FlyClumsy. The fact that such a position was created at all remains a source of speculation and intrigue.

FlyClumsy's application itself was already unusual, as it was submitted entirely in Chinese—a language long considered extinct due to the collapse of global linguistic preservation efforts. The Grand Archivist, reluctantly translating the document, found its contents perplexing and unimportant, sparking his immediate distaste for the applicant. However, despite the Archivist’s objections, FlyClumsy was not only hired but given a seemingly prestigious role without any explanation from the higher echelons of leadership.

Perhaps most bizarrely, there are occasional sightings of him outside RobCorp headquarters, dressed in full medieval jester attire. These sightings have only added to the mystery surrounding his employment, as RobCorp has no record of providing him with such a costume—and no official documentation exists regarding jesters in any of RobCorp’s archives. How FlyClumsy acquired this attire—and more importantly, *why* he wears it—remains one of RobCorp's most baffling enigmas.

### **Personality:**
Although little is known about FlyClumsy due to his persistent absence from work, several unofficial reports have emerged from those who have encountered him outside corporate walls:

- **Laid Back Nature:** Eyewitnesses describe him as unfazed by corporate norms or societal expectations. His aloofness seems to transcend any concern for traditional responsibilities or professional obligations.
  
- **Speculated Chinese Roots:** Given his initial application was written in Chinese (a language no longer in use), many speculate that FlyClumsy may have some connection to ancient Chinese culture or history. However, this is purely conjectural, as no further documentation on his background exists within RobCorp’s records.

- **Funny and Ecstatic:** On the rare occasions when employees have interacted with him outside the workplace, he's described as funny and energetic. His humor, though strange and eccentric, seems to resonate with those who meet him—though these interactions are brief and often clouded by the absurdity of his attire.

### **Notable Incidents:**

1. **[[The Application Incident]]:**  
   Upon receiving an application written entirely in Chinese, the [[Grand Archivist]] was summoned to translate the document—a task he took on reluctantly. The contents of the application were mundane and unremarkable, yet somehow FlyClumsy was immediately granted employment. The Grand Archivist has repeatedly voiced his disapproval of this event, stating that the translation effort was "a waste of historical preservation resources." It is worth noting that this incident marked a noticeable shift in the Archivist's mood whenever FlyClumsy’s name is mentioned.

2. **Jester Outfit Sighting:**  
   Several employees reported spotting FlyClumsy on Rekron Street near RobCorp Tower wearing what they described as an authentic medieval jester’s outfit—complete with bells and motley colors. When questioned about this sighting, the Grand Archivist vehemently denied ever providing any historical information on medieval jesters to anyone within RobCorp. There are no official records indicating how or why FlyClumsy would have access to such attire.

3. **[[CEO]] Connection:**  
   One of the most puzzling elements of FlyClumsy's employment is his rumored close relationship with NurRobin, RobCorp’s CEO. Despite never being seen in any corporate meetings or gatherings, there are whispers among employees that NurRobin himself requested FlyClumsy’s hiring—though there is no formal documentation supporting these claims. Their supposed friendship remains shrouded in mystery, adding another layer of intrigue to FlyClumsy’s existence within the corporation.

### **Internal Remarks:**

- **CEO NurRobin’s Remark:**  
   “Sometimes you need someone who doesn’t follow the rules to remind you why you wrote them in the first place... or why you should ignore them entirely. FlyClumsy might be absent, but in his absence, he’s doing exactly what I want—stirring things up without lifting a finger.”  

   *(NurRobin’s comment here provides little clarification but implies that FlyClumsy serves a purpose beyond conventional understanding—one that aligns with the CEO’s broader strategic vision.)*

- **Grand Archivist’s Remark:**  
   “Chinese? A dead language resurrected just to waste my time? If I had known this would lead to such folly, I would have left it untranslated. And this ‘Court Jester’ nonsense offends my sensibilities—there is no record of jesters being relevant to our mission! Why he parades around in such attire is a question for historians far less discerning than myself.”  

   *(As expected, the Grand Archivist remains deeply displeased with FlyClumsy’s entire existence within RobCorp and views him as an unnecessary anomaly.)*

### **Final Commentary Section:**

**CEO NurRobin:**  
“You know, even if FlyClumsy never shows up for a single day of work—which he hasn’t—I’m glad we brought him on board. He’s shaking things up just by existing... or not existing. Either way works for me. Sometimes disruption is more important than productivity.”

**Grand Archivist:**  
“Disruption? Disruption! You’ve allowed a man draped in ridiculous historic garb to infiltrate our ranks under the guise of ‘employment,’ and you call it disruption? It’s an insult to the Archives—to history itself! His very presence tarnishes everything we stand for.”

**CEO NurRobin:**  
“I think you’re taking this a bit too seriously. The Archives will survive one harmless jester—besides, he adds a bit of color to this otherwise sterile corporate environment.”

**Grand Archivist:**  
“Color? What we need is *clarity*. There are no jesters in our records because there are no jesters needed at RobCorp. If you continue down this path of whimsical indulgence, I fear for our historical accuracy.”

**CEO NurRobin:**  
“Relax. No one remembers history better than us... Even if it occasionally wears a jester’s hat.”
