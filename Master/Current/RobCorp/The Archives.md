## Overview

The Archives of RobCorp are a place of mysteries there is only one known person in existence who has a complete grasp of their structure, the [[Grand Archivist]].  Some reports of the inner structure made their way into the broader universe. These reports have sparked quite a bit of interest in those wishing to get glimpses into the more secretive truths of the universe. The attempts to peer into the layout were all thwarted by the fact that all of the reports never shared even one identical corridor, not even the entrance. It is currently unknown if these differences are due to some sort of memory tampering, some kind of powerful illusion or if the archives keep constantly shifting which could be realistic  considering the personality of the ever so enigmatic [[Grand Archivist]].

## Layout

Under orders of the [[Grand Archivist]] the actual layout of **The Archives** are being kept secret. This doesn't mean there aren't any reports of the layout. Although these reports cannot be trusted completely especially considering their contradictory nature in and of itself. 

### Three extracted structures

 There have been three main structures which could be extracted from the reports that made their way onto the galactic stage. These have been named **The Library**, **The Garden of Truth** and **The Sphere of Madness**. It is not confirmed if there is a **TRUE** form of **The Archives** but these three are the most prevalent forms in reports concerning the inner layout of **The Archives**.

#### The Library 

**The Library** is the most ordinary of the three layouts, at least as normal as **The Archives** can be considered "normal". The library consists of a seemingly endless amount of corridors filled to the brim with books. These corridors seem to be ever shifting in at least three dimensions.

#### The Garden of Truth

**The Garden of Truth** looks like a meticulously cared for garden world. Throughout these sprawling gardens there are various small auditoriums were speakers impart specific knowledge. Of note is the fact that no one ever heard any lecturer they weren't supposed to, as if there were force fields blocking out the sounds.  

#### The Sphere of Madness

Whilst the other two instances of **The Archives** where harmless to the ones visiting **The Sphere of Madness** drives the ones who've seen it to the brink of sanity and in most cases **The Sphere** breaks the mind completely. It is unknown if this has something to do with **The Sphere** itself or with the knowledge one gets imparted with when being pulled into it's realm.  

### Speculations

**The Archives** enshrouded in so many secrets that not many institutions cam compete.  Whilst there are speculations of all kinds flowing around most of them agree i one point. **The Archives** are far more than they appear to be. Some of the greatest minds have tried to make sense of them and failed. Some believe **The Archives** to be some kind of doorway to higher dimensions and with that the [[Grand Archivist]] to be some avatar of a being living a higher dimension. [[RobCorp|RobCorp's]] own [[Propaganda Expert|Propaganda Expert's]] are officially ignoring these theories as they are still unsure on how to deal with them properly to increase [[RobCorp|RobCorp's]] revenue. some more religious inclined groups believe **The Archives** to be either some kind of Holy Land or the temptation of the Devil. There have even been some minor incidents involving these groups with a few dozen dead people. (More business for [[RobCorp]]) 

>Note from the **Grand Archivist**:
	"It's quite funny seeing these fools bickering about something they'll never understand in a hundred lifetimes."

## Capabilities 

Rumors going around the corridors of [[RobCorp]] suggest that the archives reach even beyond the reaches of the organization. The most outrageous of these rumors go as far as to suggest that [[Die Rote Sonne]] knows all that is happening within the human domain and even beyond.  Some extremists even believe **The Archives** to be involved in a multitude of political assassinations and inciting of revolts on a major scale. Though these allegations are widely known their was never an investigation since any and all investigations have been halted through unknown means.

>Note from the CEO:
>	"At this pointed I've given up on understanding **The Archives** and anything associated with them. They are not reducing our profit margins so it's not worth the headache."

## The [[Black Flag Mercenary Group]] Incident

With the mysteries surrounding **The Archives** there came many profiteers that tried to get a scan of **The Archives** in order to make some quick money or just to satiate their curiosity. Whilst there weren't many that made it past initial screening of [[RobCorp]] security only one organization managed to get two ships to actually scan **The Archives**. They barely managed to send their records to a remote relay station when the ships disappeared. The scans themselves were quite horrifying, the scans revealed there to be nothing were **The Archives** should be located based on the rumors. The ships themselves reappeared, after six days of being MIA, in front of the flagship of the [[Black Flag Mercenary Group|BFMG]]. This prompted an immediate investigation by the [[Black Flag Mercenary Group|BFMG]]. According to their publicized records no scanners were able to penetrate the hull. Once an investigation team made it on board of the ships they only discovered these ships to be completely filled with blood. 
 
>Note from the **Grand Archivist**:
	"The Black flag Mercenary Group fucked around and found out, quite simple"
