On May 14th 1886 a whirlwind rages in the City of [Crossen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krosno_Odrza%C5%84skie). In the aftermath of the Whirlwind, many people died and were thrown into mass graves. Appalled by the sight of his town's people being unceremoniously thrown into the mass grave, [[Robert Cornelius]], a young woodworker, choose to forgo his business of furniture production in favor of making coffins. The ones Robert
made for the people which died in the disaster were still of poorer quality, but over the next year Robert became known in the region as one of the best coffin makers. During that year Robert made coffins for all kinds of people, the common people, merchants some wealthier than others even for some minor nobles here and there.  

On the 13th of November 1886 Robert met [[Karl]] a seasoned stone mason. For unknown reasons Karl decided to join Robert in his Coffin building endeavors. Some sources mention a bet between the two, which Karl apparently lost in a spectacular manner. Although these sources could not be properly verified.  These two continued building Coffins, now officially under the name[[Cornelius' Coffins]].
